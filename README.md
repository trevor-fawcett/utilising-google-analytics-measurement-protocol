# Utilising Google Analytics Measurement Protocol (GAMP)
I wanted to try a programmatic approach to recording analytics and GAMP appears to offer that. You could say I wanted to control what scripts were utilised by my web apps or that I wanted to protect my users from tracking, but in reality I just wanted to try something new (to me).
## Approach
- Build a simple web app.
- Create an analytics baseline using traditional GA script.
- Recreate baseline using GAMP in a copy of the web app.
- Extend to record behaviour known only to the web app back-end.
- Document experience, so that others might benefit.
